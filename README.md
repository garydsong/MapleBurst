Damage: +30%, Damage increases over time: +9% (maxes at 90%)

The blessing of Cygnus increases damage and restores HP over time.

Note: You want to use this first to take advantage of the stacking damage % increase
```

Duration: 60s 

Damage: +10%, Cosmic Orb Max Stacks: +5

Creates max cosmic orbs upon use. 

```
Note: This makes your orb stack max go from 5 to 10 which inherently buffs your Cosmic Shower and Cosmic Burst
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/phalanx-charge.png) Phalanx Charge

Damage: 990%

Spearmen disappear when the number of attacks is reached, they move a certain distance, or after a certain duration. Activate the skill again to change their direction.

```
Note: These can be a little difficult to keep track of at first but after some practice you'll
find that if you're only going to have to hit it two or three times to get the full duration off.
I don't recommend trying to keep track of it on your first go around.
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/true-arachnid-reflection.png) True Arachnid Reflection

Goes into attack mode at set intervals. During attack mode, uses spider legs 10 times to deal 385% damage 8 times. If the spider legs attack one target 5 consecutive times, attack mode will end immediately.

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/cosmos.png) Cosmos

Duration: 15s

Damage over time: (990% x Number of Attacks: 5) x 15s

```
Note: Only activate this if you're close enough
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/soul-eclipse.png) Soul Eclipse

Duration: 40s

Damage over time: 990%, Number of Attacks: 40

Reactivate Damage: 2750%, Number of Attacks: 15

```
Note: For me, at first, it was really challenging to keep track of the Soul Eclipse icon especially 
while bossing and having 3 lines of buffs active. Ideally you want to reactivate this when there's 
2-3 seconds left. A habit I created was looking for it around the 10s-7s left mark and just constantly
glance over until the numbers disappear. This is a good indicator that it's time to reactivate it.
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/rift-of-damnation.png) Rift of Damnation

Duration: 40s

Creates max cosmic orbs

Rift - Gradually grows when it's attacked by Styx Crossing and in the end. 
Max Enemies Hit: 15, Damage: 1150%, Number of Attacks: 6, Number of Explosions: 5

```
Note: Rift is nothing you really need to pay attention to, it'll just give you a passive burst
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/cosmic-shower.png) Cosmic Shower

Duration: 55s (if your hyperskills are in damage and persist)

Damage: 230%, Number of Attacks: 3

```
Note: If you casted Cosmos, hit boss with a normal attack before casting to replenish 10 orbs before casting.
```

### ![image](https://github.com/garydsong/MapleBurst/blob/main/src/assets/Classes/DawnWarrior/astral-blitz.png) Astral Blitz

Chase Cut:
Damage: 3720% damage x 14 times x 5 times

Big Bang:
Damage: 5115% damage x 5 times x 7 times

Increases final damage by 5% for 20 seconds when used

```
Note: No actives or anything to worry about just activate the origin skill and let it ride.
```
